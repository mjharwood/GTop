0.16 - dev 

Disable the build of GTop::Server, as libgtop 2.0+ has problems
building Server/. Most likely nobody uses it anyway, and if someone does they should let us know...

0.15 - Mon Apr 25 16:43:32 EDT 2005

#include <glibtop/command.h> is needed to build against libgtop 2.9.91 
[ville.skytta@iki.fi]

include the autogenerated GTop.pod in the distro, so that
search.cpan.org shows the right docs.

added examples/perlbloat.pl

Recent Test::Builder versions share test numbers only if threads.pm is
already loaded: fix the threads test to load threads.pm first. [Ruslan
U. Zakirov <Ruslan.Zakirov@acronis.com>]

trying to modify $_ which points to a constant in the autogenerated
test.gtop [Eric Cholet]
